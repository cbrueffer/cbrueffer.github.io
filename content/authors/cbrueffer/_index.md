I am a Genomic Data Scientist currently working as a Senior Bioinformatician at the cancer diagnostics company [SAGA Diagnostics](http://sagadiagnostics.com/) and am affiliated with
[Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/persons/christian-brueffer%2834807b93-a7ad-4694-82b7-2a665a620c14%29.html) in Sweden.

My research focuses on the development of diagnostics based on tumor DNA/RNA deep sequencing
(also known as next generation sequencing) to improve treatment and survival of cancer patients.
Most of my projects are embedded in the [Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network--Breast (SCAN-B)](https://www.scan-b.lu.se/) breast cancer study.
Additionally I work on improving open source bioinformatics and reproducible research infrastructure
by contributing to projects such as [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/), and [Biopython](http://biopython.org/).

Over the past 20 years I have contributed to a number of open source software projects, most notably the [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) computer
operating system. A rough overview can be [found on OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/brueffer).
