I am a freelance Bioinformatician and Data Scientist providing [consulting]({{< ref "#consulting" >}}) services to clients in industry and academia to help them make sense of their data.
Previously, I lead the bioinformatics and data science team at SAGA Diagnostics, a company developing personalized cancer diagnostics based on genomics and liquid biopsy.
Additionally, I conduct research in affiliation with [Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/persons/christian-brueffer) in Sweden.

My main interest is in using computational methods and biological/medical data to improve our understanding and treatment of diseases.
Many of my projects, including my [doctoral thesis]({{< ref "/project/phd" >}}), have been focused on [cancer](tag/cancer) in humans.
Additionally I work on improving open source bioinformatics and reproducible research infrastructure
by contributing to projects such as [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), and [Biopython](https://biopython.org/).

Over the past 20 years I have contributed to a number of open source software projects, most notably the [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) computer operating system.
A rough overview can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/cbrueffer) and [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/brueffer).
