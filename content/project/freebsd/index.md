[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) is an open source Unix-like operating system that can be
found (as a whole or in parts) in Apple macOS and iOS, Sony Playstation 4, Juniper routers
and NetApp storage filers, to name a few. It also powers services such as Netflix and WhatsApp.
I have been a developer with the project since 2003, and also contribute to related security-focused
projects such as [TrustedBSD](http://www.trustedbsd.org) and [OpenBSM](https://github.com/openbsm).
