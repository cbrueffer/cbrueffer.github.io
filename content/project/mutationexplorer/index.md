Datasets are getting larger, within the [Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network--Breast][scanb] we have generated a dataset of tens
of thousands of mutations from the [rna-seq] data of thousands of breast tumors. The web application SCAN-B MutationExplorer is a way to open this dataset
up to the wider research community. The underlying software is available as open source software at https://github.com/cbrueffer/MutationExplorer.
