abstract: "Breast cancer is a disease of genomic alterations, of which the panorama of somatic mutations and how these relate to subtypes and therapy response is incompletely understood. Within SCAN‐B (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02306096), a prospective study elucidating the transcriptomic profiles for thousands of breast cancers, we developed a RNA‐seq pipeline for detection of SNVs/indels and profiled a real‐world cohort of 3,217 breast tumors. We describe the mutational landscape of primary breast cancer viewed through the transcriptome of a large population‐based cohort and relate it to patient survival. We demonstrate that RNA‐seq can be used to call mutations in genes such as *PIK3CA*, *TP53*, and *ERBB2*, as well as the status of molecular pathways and mutational burden, and identify potentially druggable mutations in 86.8% of tumors. To make this rich dataset available for the research community, we developed an open source web application, the SCAN‐B MutationExplorer (http://oncogenomics.bmc.lu.se/MutationExplorer). These results add another dimension to the use of RNA‐seq as a clinical tool, where both gene expression‐ and mutation‐based biomarkers can be interrogated in real‐time within 1 week of tumor sampling."
