abstract: "Background: The immune cell component of the tumor microenvironment is an important modulator of tumor progression and suppression. In patients with breast cancer, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represent a large part of antitumor immunity along with tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS), as they predict favorable prognosis and good treatment response. In this study, we scored for immune-related histology features using whole slide H&E images of the TCGA-BRCA dataset and analyzed these distinct features relative to gene expression patterns and molecular intrinsic subtypes. Method: A total of 1035 cases from TCGA-BRCA dataset were evaluated for TILs, plasma cells, high-endothelial venule associated lymphoid aggregate (HALA) and TLS. For HALA and TLS, location relative to tumor (non-tumor, peritumor, and intratumoral area) and number was determined. For each pathologically defined immune feature (i.e., no TLS vs TLS+), we then searched for associated gene expression features and used the top 100 significantly upregulated genes to make signatures for tumor group-based analyses. Upregulated immune modules in high-TIL tumors using a 10% TIL level cutoff were compared based on PAM50 molecular subtype (luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, basal-like). The clinical significance of histology-based gene signatures and high-TIL related immune modules was validated using bulk RNAseq and survival data from the SCAN-B cohort (N=6329). Results: HER2-enriched (HER2E) and basal-like breast tumors exhibited the highest mean TILs, with plasma cells more frequently observed in these subtypes. HALAs were present in 36.4% of cases and TLS were found in 6.5% of cases, also predominantly in HER2E and basal-like tumors. Gene signatures related to intratumoral HALA and intratumoral TLS correlated with better survival outcomes, while peritumoral HALA correlated with worse outcomes on the overall TCGA data set. In addition to TILs- and plasma cell-associated gene signatures, intratumoral HALA and intratumoral TLS correlated with HER2E and basal like tumors. High-TIL tumors revealed 164 enriched immune modules, with unique upregulated modules in each molecular subtype. For example, in luminal tumors, immune modules had little relation to favorable prognosis. High-TIL HER2E and basal-like tumors had distinct immune gene signatures linked to improved survival, with HER2E being more associated with B-cell prognostic features and basal-like subtype more associated with T-cell prognostic features. Conclusion: Different subtypes of breast cancer exhibit distinct tumor immune microenvironments, both histologically and molecularly. These differences in immune properties and biological characteristics should be considered when developing precise treatment strategies to achieve the best therapeutic efficacy for patients."
