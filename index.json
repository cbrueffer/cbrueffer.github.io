Detection of t(11;14) in MM requires bone marrow (BM) aspiration and evaluation of CD138+ plasma cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Innovative techniques may provide less invasive detection of t(11;14) in liquid biopsies. Here we present results of the SAGAsign® integrated approach combining low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize t(11;14) breakpoints together with personalized digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) assays to efficiently detect and monitor the genomic rearrangements in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Baseline BM aspirates were collected from 270 patients (pts) from Ven clinical trials (NCT02755597, NCT01794520, NCT03314181, NCT02899052). Previously generated WGS to an average coverage ~22X was used. Paired samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA and plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were analyzed by dPCR at timepoints after Ven-based treatment. Of the 90 t(11;14)+ pts by FISH, 160 t(11;14) breakpoints were identified by WGS in 74 pts. At the time of data cutoff, dPCR assays were designed and evaluated in 8 t(11;14)+ pts; 7/8 (88%) and 6/8 (75%) pts had detectable t(11;14) in cfDNA or PBMCs, respectively. Higher levels of t(11;14) mutant allele frequency (MAF) were observed in cfDNA compared with PBMCs. After Ven-based treatment, t(11;14) MAF in cfDNA became undetectable in pts with a complete response. In conclusion, this approach has the capability to reconstruct t(11;14) breakpoints from WGS data that is highly concordant with FISH; translocations appear more readily detectable in cfDNA than PBMC samples from pts with MM SAGAsign assays detected and monitored t(11;14) in liquid biopsies thus highlighting its potential utility for identifying pts with t(11;14) for targeted therapies","tags":["Cancer","Multiple Myeloma","Bioinformatics","Whole Genome Sequencing","Liquid Biopsy","Digital PCR"],"title":"Abstract 5710: Detection and monitoring of t(11;14) in liquid biopsies from patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated with venetoclax-based regimens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arturas Dobilas","Pia Leandersson","Yilun Chen","Miguel Alcaide","Christian Brueffer","Lao H.

AWS ParallelCluster Slurm has a few peculiarities in the default configuration. For running Snakemake an adapted profile is available at https://github.com/cbrueffer/snakemake-aws-parallelcluster-slurm to make things work smoothly. Running Snakemake on AWS ParallelCluster Snakemake is a fantastic tool for orchestrating bioinformatics workflows and comes with built-in support for a variety of public cloud providers, such as Amazon AWS. However, running a workflow this way can be a challenge, not least since hands-on tutorials or more practical information are rare. An alternative that many bioinformaticians will be familiar with are high-performance computing (HPC) clusters using a job scheduler such as Slurm, since many universities and research facilities operate such systems on their own premises.\nAWS ParallelCluster AWS ParallelCluster makes it possible and relatively easy to replicate such a setting in the cloud. ParallelCluster is essentially a wrapper around more basic AWS services such as EC2 (running virtual machines), EFS and EBS (storage), and others.\nPros and Cons Pros\nFeasible to set up for a single user or small company / research group without huge resources. It scales dynamically: nodes are allocated when needed and decommissioned when unused. Practically infinite resources: you can allocate as many nodes and use as much storage as you want. It makes it easy to transfer a workflow from a traditional on-premise HPC setting into the cloud. Cons\nIn a university setting you can often get time on HPC systems for free, only requiring a short project description. Cloud-based HPC will cost you actual money. Traditional HPC clusters have qualified systems and network administrators that keep things running smoothly. With ParallelCluster you are the systems and network administrator, for better or worse. While many things are automated, Amazon AWS is nothing if not complex and it still requires knowledge to make things work. Setup The first steps of using ParallelCluster are pretty well documented. All tasks are performed with the aws-parallelcluster Python package. Note that there are currently two versions of the ParallelCluster software, v2 and v3. v3 is newer and has more features, but many guides and help you currently find online are based on v2. The most visual difference is the configuration format: v3 uses YAML while v2 uses INI files.\nConfigure an AWS user with the correct permissions. A basic policy is provided in the AWS documentation, but if you need access to services such as EFS more permissions will be needed. Set up the AWS user’s credentials using aws configure. Either import an SSH public key in the EC2 settings, or generate a new key pair. Install the aws-parallelcluster Python package using pip as documented. The package is also available through conda via the conda-forge channel, but as of this writing it is v2 only. Set up a cluster configuration using pcluster configure --config my-cluster-config.yaml. This starts an interactive process that various settings of the cluster, i.e. which instance type to use for the head node, which scheduler to use (Slurm or AWS Batch), how many queues, number of nodes per queue, etc. In particular sets up the necessary virtual private cloud (VPC), network infrastructure, and security groups on AWS automatically, if you tell it to do so. Start the cluster using pcluster create-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster --cluster-configuration my-cluster-config.yaml. This will take a few minutes; you can check progress using pcluster describe-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster. Log in to the head node using pcluster ssh --cluster-name test-cluster. Snakemake on ParallelCluster with Slurm Peculiarities of ParallelCluster Slurm Instances Generally using Snakemake on a ParallelCluster Slurm cluster works the same as with any other Slurm system. That said, there are some differences and drawbacks, and they are not well documented and as such, are learned through the usual cycle of trial, error, and searching the web.\nThe sbatch --mem argument for specifying memory requirements for a job is not supported, and if used will send nodes into the DRAINED state. The company Ronin has a good troubleshooting page on this topic. If you are the sole user of your cluster the easiest workaround is probably to scale jobs using the number of CPUs (--cpus-per-task).\nBy default, a ParallelCluster comes without working job accounting, which means sacct does not work. This is particularly noteworthy since many Snakemake Slurm profiles use sacct for job monitoring.

Diagnostics is one area where biotechnology has been critical. Diagnostic tests play a vital role in managing a viral threat by facilitating the detection of infected and/or recovered individuals. From the perspective of what information is provided, these tests fall into two major categories, molecular and serological. Molecular diagnostic techniques assay whether a virus is present in a biological sample, thus making it possible to identify individuals who are currently infected. Additionally, when the immune system is exposed to a virus, it responds by producing antibodies specific to the virus. Serological tests make it possible to identify individuals who have mounted an immune response to a virus of interest and therefore facilitate the identification of individuals who have previously encountered the virus. These two categories of tests provide different perspectives valuable to understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Within these categories, different biotechnological approaches offer specific advantages and disadvantages. Here we review the categories of tests developed for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the role of diagnostics in the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19"],"title":"Molecular and Serologic Diagnostic Technologies for SARS-CoV-2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hina Dalal","Malin Dahlgren","Sergii Gladchuk","Christian Brueffer","Sofia K.

Previous studies had some disagreement, however most reports suggested a more favorable prognosis for patients with high ESR2 expression. To add further clarity to ESR2 in breast cancer, we interrogated a large population-based cohort of primary breast tumors (n = 3207) from the SCAN-B study. RNA-seq shows ESR2 is expressed at low levels overall with a slight inverse correlation to ESR1 expression (Spearman R = −0.18, p = 2.2e−16), and highest ESR2 expression in the basal- and normal-like PAM50 subtypes. ESR2-high tumors had favorable overall survival (p = 0.006), particularly in subgroups receiving endocrine therapy (p = 0.03) and in triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.01). These results were generally robust in multivariable analyses accounting for patient age, tumor size, node status, and grade. Gene modules consistent with immune response were associated to ESR2-high tumors. Taken together, our results indicate that ESR2 is generally expressed at low levels in breast cancer but associated with improved overall survival and may be related to immune response modulation.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","SCAN-B","RNA Sequencing","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Clinical associations of ESR2 (estrogen receptor beta; ERβ) expression across thousands of primary breast tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Halie M.

Only a few coronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two cause infections similar in severity to SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a species closely related to SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Unlike the current pandemic, previous epidemics were controlled rapidly through public health measures, but the body of research investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome has proven valuable for identifying approaches to treating and preventing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Building on this research, the medical and scientific communities have responded rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and identified many candidate therapeutics. The approaches used to identify candidates fall into four main categories: adaptation of clinical approaches to diseases with related pathologies, adaptation based on virological properties, adaptation based on host response, and data-driven identification (ID) of candidates based on physical properties or on pharmacological compendia. To date, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while most remain under investigation. The scale of the COVID-19 crisis offers a rare opportunity to collect data on the effects of candidate therapeutics. This information provides insight not only into the management of coronavirus diseases but also into the relative success of different approaches to identifying candidate therapeutics against an emerging disease.","tags":["SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19"],"title":"Identification and Development of Therapeutics for COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Halie M.

Here, we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host. Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus’s structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally, prior research into interactions between the human immune system and coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system’s protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.","tags":["SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19"],"title":"Pathogenesis, Symptomatology, and Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through Analysis of Viral Genomics and Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634731200,"objectID":"b4823f088f3f7cc496271e3642b2cbb1","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/swedish-bioinformatics-workshop-2021-saga-diagnostics-sponsor-presentation/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/swedish-bioinformatics-workshop-2021-saga-diagnostics-sponsor-presentation/","section":"event","summary":"SAGA Diagnostics sponsor presentation.","tags":[],"title":"Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop 2021: SAGA Diagnostics Sponsor Presentation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Ronan Lordan","Halie M.

Existing treatments that can be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents may reduce the pandemic’s devastation. Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, and these products may help alleviate deficiencies. For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in the COVID-19 crisis.","tags":["SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19"],"title":"Dietary Supplements and Nutraceuticals under Investigation for COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Malin Dahlgren","Anthony M.

Many people worldwide work on translating these insights into the clinic to improve diagnostic areas such as patient risk stratification and treatment selection. Most of these efforts focus on DNA-based short-read high-throughput sequencing (DNA-seq).\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a sister technology to DNA-seq that probes the current state of the cell’s transcriptional machinery (the transcriptome) and is commonly used for research, but is underused as a diagnostic tool. RNA-seq is inexpensive and can provide a wealth of information that is not accessible from DNA (gene/isoform expression), in addition to being able, to some degree, to detect features commonly determined from DNA (e.g., point mutations, short insertions and deletions, copy number, structural variants). As such it is possible to develop a variety of diagnostics that can be derived from a single sequencing dataset, making RNA-seq a potentially powerful diagnostic tool.\nThe topic of my PhD thesis was exploring the diagnostic power of RNA-seq by developing and evaluating computational resources for the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network–Breast (SCAN-B) breast cancer project and by developing diagnostic tools from the generated data. Within SCAN-B the vast majority of breast cancer patients from the participating hospital regions are being enrolled since 2010, and RNA-seq data is being generated from their tumors within one week from surgery.\nSee below for a list of results generated from this work.\n","date":1608249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608249600,"objectID":"9723547690e3a2bfcc5abe05ad0b6994","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2020-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"My PhD work in developing RNA sequencing-based diagnostic tools for breast cancer.","tags":["PhD","Cancer","Breast Cancer","RNA Sequencing"],"title":"PhD Project: RNA Sequencing-based Tools for Breast Cancer Diagnostics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608249600,"objectID":"69dad282907c8521fec00b48a5259a8f","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/publication/2020_phd_thesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_phd_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and, in Sweden, is the most deadly second only to lung cancer. While treatment and diagnostic options have improved in the past decades and short- to mid-term survival is good, long-term survival is much poorer. On the other hand, many women are likely cured by surgery and radiotherapy alone, but receive unnecessary adjuvant treatment leading to undesirable health-related and economic side-effects. Reliably differentiating high-risk from low-risk patients to provide optimal treatment remains a challenge.\nThe Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network–Breast (SCAN-B) project was initiated in 2009 and aims to improve breast cancer outcomes by developing new diagnostics and treatment-predictive tests. Within SCAN-B, tumor material and blood are being biobanked and the transcriptomes of many thousands of breast tumors are being analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The resulting sample collection and dataset provide an unprecedented resource for research, and the information therein may harbor ways to improve prognosis and to predict tumor susceptibility or resistance to therapies.\nIn the four original studies included in this thesis we explored the use of RNA-seq as a diagnostic tool within breast cancer. In study I we described the SCAN-B processes and protocols, and analyzed early data to show the feasibility of using RNA-seq as a diagnostic platform. We showed that the patient population enrolled in SCAN-B largely reflects the characteristics of the total breast cancer patient population and benchmarked RNA-seq against prior techniques. In study II we diagnosed problems in commonly used RNA-seq alignment software and described the development of a software tool to correct the problems and improve data usability. Study III focused on diagnostics for determining the status of the important breast cancer biomarkers ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67, and Nottingham histological grade. We assessed the reproducibility of histopathology in measuring these biomarkers, and developed new ways of predicting their status using RNA-seq-based gene expression. We showed that expression-based biomarkers add value to histopathology by improving prognostic possibilities. In study IV we focused on the prospects of using RNA-seq to detect mutations. We developed a new computational method to profile mutations and used it to describe the mutational landscape of thousands of patient tumors and its impact on patient survival. In particular, we identified mutations in a subset of patients that are known to confer resistance to standard treatments.\nThe hope is that, together, the diagnostic results made possible by the studies herein may one day enable oncologists to adapt treatment plans accordingly and improve patient quality of life and outcomes.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","SCAN-B","Bioinformatics"],"title":"RNA Sequencing for Molecular Diagnostics in Breast Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer","Sergii Gladchuk","Christof Winter","Johan Vallon-Christersson","Cecilia Hegardt","Jari Häkkinen","Anthony M.

Due to inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau tumour suppressor, the hypoxia‐inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are constitutively activated in these tumours, resulting in a pseudo‐hypoxic phenotype. The HIFs induce the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and cell survival, but they also reset the cellular metabolism to protect cells from oxygen and nutrient deprivation. ccRCC tumours are highly vascularized and the cytoplasm of the cancer cells is filled with lipid droplets and glycogen, resulting in the histologically distinctive pale (clear) cytoplasm. Intratumoural heterogeneity may occur, and in some tumours, areas with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm are found. Little is known regarding these traits and how they relate to the coexistent clear cell component, yet eosinophilic ccRCC is associated with higher grade and clinically more aggressive tumours. In this study, we have for the first time performed RNA sequencing comparing histologically verified clear cell and eosinophilic areas from ccRCC tissue, aiming to analyse the characteristics of these cell types. Findings from RNA sequencing were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of biphasic ccRCC. We found that the eosinophilic phenotype displayed a higher proliferative drive and lower differentiation, and we confirmed a correlation to tumours of higher stage. We further identified mutations of the tumour suppressor p53 (*TP53*) exclusively in the eosinophilic ccRCC component, where mTORC1 activity was also elevated. Also, eosinophilic areas were less vascularized, yet harboured more abundant infiltrating immune cells. The cytoplasm of clear cell ccRCC cells was filled with lipids but had very low mitochondrial content, while the reverse was found in eosinophilic tissue. We herein suggest possible transcriptional mechanisms behind these phenomena.","tags":["Cancer","Kidney Cancer","RNA Sequencing","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Features of increased malignancy in eosinophilic clear cell renal cell carcinoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Malin Dahlgren","Anthony M.

SVCurator displays images from short, long, and linked read sequencing data from the GIAB Ashkenazi Jewish Trio son [NIST RM 8391/HG002]. We asked curators to assign labels describing SV type (deletion or insertion), size accuracy, and genotype for 1235 putative insertions and deletions sampled from different size bins between 20 and 892,149 bp. ‘Expert’ curators were 93% concordant with each other, and 37 of the 61 curators had at least 78% concordance with a set of ‘expert’ curators. The curators were least concordant for complex SVs and SVs that had inaccurate breakpoints or size predictions. After filtering events with low concordance among curators, we produced high confidence labels for 935 events. The SVCurator crowdsourced labels were 94.5% concordant with the heuristic-based draft benchmark SV callset from GIAB. We found that curators can successfully evaluate putative SVs when given evidence from multiple sequencing technologies.","tags":["Structural Variants","Genome in a Bottle","Open Source Software","Bioinformatics"],"title":"A crowdsourced set of curated structural variants for the human genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590739200,"objectID":"36d6dea8151631ab56cb53ad38845801","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/asco-2020-mutational-landscape-of-the-primary-breast-cancer-transcriptome/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T08:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/asco-2020-mutational-landscape-of-the-primary-breast-cancer-transcriptome/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","RNA Sequencing","SCAN-B","PhD"],"title":"Defining the Mutational Landscape of 3,217 Primary Breast Cancer Transcriptomes through large-scale RNA-seq within the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network: Breast Project (SCAN-B; NCT03430492)","type":"event"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer","Sergii Gladchuk","Christof Winter","Johan Vallon-Christersson","Cecilia Hegardt","Jari Häkkinen","Anthony M George","Yilun Chen","Anna Ehinger","Christer Larsson","Niklas Loman","Martin Malmberg","Lisa Rydén","Åke Borg","Lao H.

All patients had a central venous access to allow administration of intravenous neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which enabled blood collection from superior vena cava, draining the breasts, in addition to sampling from a peripheral vein.\n**Results**\nCTC and ctDNA positivity was seen in 26% and 65% of the patients, respectively. There was a significant increase of ctDNA after breast compression in central blood (p = 0.01), not observed in peripheral testing. No increase related with breast compression was observed for CTC. ctDNA positivity was associated with older age (p = 0.05), and ctDNA increase after breast compression was associated with high Ki67 proliferating tumors (p = 0.04).

In the case of residual disease, a change in subtypes may be observed. Sensitive and reproducible biomarkers predicting treatment response early during the treatment course are needed in order to better exploit the potential benefit of an individualized preoperative treatment.\n**Material and Methods**\nIn an ongoing prospective study within the population-based SCAN-B project (NCT02306096), patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy for early or locally recurrent breast cancer have been treated with iv Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide q3w x 3 in sequence with either Docetaxel q3w x 3 or Paclitaxel q1w x 9 with a preoperative intent. HER2-positive cases also received HER2-directed treatment. At baseline, patients were staged using sentinel node biopsy for clinically node-negative patients and CT scan for cytologically confirmed node-positive cases. A clinical core needle biopsy as well as tissue from the surgical specimen was collected for determination of conventional biomarkers including ER, PgR, HER2 and Ki67. Tumor biopsies for biomolecule-extraction and RNA-sequencing were taken using ultrasound guidance and collected fresh in RNAlater at baseline, after 2 treatment cycles, as well as at surgery. Blood plasma samples were collected at baseline, after one-, three-, and six- 3w treatment cycles, and post-surgery. Using RNA-sequencing data, somatic mutations were identified in the tumor biopsies and personalized analyses for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were performed. A pathological complete remission (pCR) was defined as the complete disappearance of invasive breast cancer in the breast and axilla at time of definitive surgery. Subtyping was performed using modified St Gallen criteria (2013).\n**Results**\nThus far, 45 patients aged 24-74 years have been included, of which 34 (76 %) were clinical stage 2 and 11 (24%) were stage 3. The subtype distribution at baseline was five Luminal A-like (11 %), 21 Luminal B-like (HER2 negative) (47 %), 8 HER2-positive (18 %) and 11 Triple-negative (ductal) (24 %). The rates of pCR in 38 operated cases to date were 0/3 Luminal A-like, 3/19 Luminal B-like (HER2 negative), 2/8 HER2-positive, and 4/7 Triple-negative (overall 24 % pCR rate). One patient did not undergo surgery due to clinically progressive disease. In 25 cases with evaluable residual disease at surgery, there was a shift in the subtype in 13 (52 %), the majority of which represented a transition from Luminal B to Luminal A. No Triple-negative cases underwent a change in subtype during treatment. Results of the ctDNA analyses will be presented at the meeting.\n**Discussion**\nWe have established an infrastructure allowing for an extensive evaluation of preoperative chemotherapy in early breast cancer. The goal is to develop methods to refine response-guided treatment in early breast cancer using molecular responses in the tumor as well as in the blood circulation. The patients continue to be prospectively monitored with iterative ctDNA analyses during follow-up.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","Liquid Biopsy","SCAN-B"],"title":"Abstract P2-02-09: Breast cancer subtype distribution and circulating tumor DNA in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Experiences from a preoperative cohort within SCAN-B","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer","Johan Vallon-Christersson","Dorthe Grabau","Anna Ehinger","Jari Häkkinen","Cecilia Hegardt","Janne Malina","Yilun Chen","Pär-Ola Bendahl","Jonas Manjer","Martin Malmberg","Christer Larsson","Niklas Loman","Lisa Rydén","Åke Borg","Lao H.

We aimed to develop classifiers for these biomarkers based on tumor mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), compare classification performance to conventional histopathology, and test whether RNA-seq-based predictors could add value for patient risk-stratification.\n**Patients and Methods**\nIn total, 3678 breast tumors were studied. For 405 breast tumors in the training cohort, a comprehensive histopathological biomarker evaluation was performed by three pathology readings to estimate inter-pathologist variability on the original diagnostic slides as well as on repeat immunostains for this study, and the consensus biomarker status for all five conventional biomarkers was determined. Whole transcriptome gene expression profiling was performed by RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform. Using RNA-seq-derived tumor gene expression data as input, single-gene classifiers (SGC) and multi-gene classifiers (MGC) were trained on the consensus pathology biomarker labels. The trained classifiers were tested on an independent prospective population-based series of 3273 primary breast cancer cases from the multicenter SCAN-B study with median 41 months follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02306096), and classifications were evaluated by agreement statistics and by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analyses.\n**Results**\nFor the histopathological evaluation, pathologist evaluation concordance was high for ER, PgR, and HER2 (average kappa values of .920, .891, and .899, respectively), but moderate for Ki67 and NHG (.734 and .581). Classification concordance between RNA-seq classifiers and histopathology for the independent 3273-cohort was similar to that within histopathology assessments, with SGCs slightly outperforming MGCs. Importantly, patients with discordant results, classified as hormone responsive (HoR+) by histopathology but non-hormone responsive by MGC, presented with significantly inferior overall survival compared to patients with concordant results. These results extended to patients with no adjuvant systemic therapy (hazard ratio, HR, 4.54; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.42-14.5), endocrine therapy alone (HR 3.46; 95% CI, 2.01-5.95), or receiving chemotherapy (HR 2.57; 95% CI 1.13-5.86).

However, when benchmarked using overall survival, our RNA-seq classifiers provided added clinical value in particular for cases that are determined by histopathology to be hormone-responsive but by RNA-seq appear hormone-insensitive and have a significantly poorer outcome when treated with endocrine therapy alone.","tags":["Cancer","Multiple Myeloma","Bioinformatics","Whole Genome Sequencing","Liquid Biopsy","Digital PCR"],"title":"Abstract P4-09-03: On the development and clinical value of RNA-sequencing-based classifiers for prediction of the five conventional breast cancer biomarkers: A report from the population-based multicenter SCAN-B study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500738360,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500738360,"objectID":"8c87b5fb5588bf3e1a7621b58675e23c","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/biopython-project-update-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-22T15:46:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/biopython-project-update-2017/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Open Source Software","Biopython"],"title":"Biopython Project Update 2017","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1468072800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1468072800,"objectID":"ef611a13e7b7465a83084a93f4e7a299","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/biopython-project-update-2016/","publishdate":"2016-07-09T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/biopython-project-update-2016/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Open Source Software","Biopython"],"title":"Biopython Project Update 2016","type":"event"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer","Lao H.

Although there have been indications that the second tumor (BC2) sometimes may represent a metastatic spread of BC1, this has never been conclusively shown. We sought to apply next-generation sequencing to determine a “genetic barcode” for each tumor and reveal the clonal relationship of CBCs.\n**Methods**\nTen CBC patients with detailed clinical information and available fresh frozen tumor tissue were studied. Using low-coverage whole genome DNA-sequencing data for each tumor, chromosomal rearrangements were enumerated and copy number profiles were generated. Comparisons between tumors provided an estimate of clonal relatedness for tumor pairs within individual patients.\n**Results**\nBetween 15–256 rearrangements were detected in each tumor (median 87). For one patient, 76 % (68 out of 90) of the rearrangements were shared between BC1 and BC2, highly consistent with what has been seen for true primary-metastasis pairs (\u003e50 %) and thus confirming a common clonal origin of the two tumors. For most of the remaining cases, BC1 and BC2 had similarly low overlap as unmatched randomized pairs of tumors from different individuals, suggesting the CBC to represent a new independent primary tumor.\n**Conclusion**\nUsing rearrangement fingerprinting, we show for the first time with certainty that a contralateral BC2 can represent a metastatic spread of BC1. Given the poor prognosis of a generalized disease compared to a new primary tumor, these women need to be identified at diagnosis of CBC for appropriate determination of treatment. Our approach generates a promising new method to assess clonal relationship between tumors. Additional studies are required to confirm the frequency of CBCs representing metastatic events.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","Structural Variants","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Contralateral breast cancer can represent a metastatic spread of the first primary tumor: determination of clonal relationship between contralateral breast cancers using next-generation whole genome sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Man-Hung Eric Tang","Malin Dahlgren","Christian Brueffer","Christof Winter","Yilun Chen","Eleonor Olsson","Martin Sjöström","Pär-Ola Bendahl","Emma Niméus-Malmström","Lao H.

Our aim was to investigate, by analyzing chromosomal structural variation, the clonal similarities between primary breast tumors and their matched distant metastases. For 11 patients, we performed low-coverage (∼10x) whole-genome sequencing on 11 primary breast tumors and 13 matched distant metastases to enumerate chromosomal rearrangements. The tumor genomes (n = 24) harbored a median of 85 (range 18-405) chromosomal rearrangements per tumor, with a median of 82 (26-310) in primaries compared to 87 (18-405) in distant metastases. Similarity between tumors was assessed based on presence or absence of chromosomal rearrangements. Concordance between matched primaries and distant metastases from the same patient was high, with a median of 89% rearrangements being shared (range 61-100%). Nearly all of the rearrangements were patient-specific, with very little overlap when comparing all possible pairings of tumors from different patients (median 3%). The tumors exhibited different genomic patterns of rearrangements: some carried events scattered throughout the genome while other tumors had events in densely clustered foci - chromothripsis-like hotspots - at a few chromosomal locations. Irrespective of the type of rearrangement profile of the tumor genomes, the patterns were highly conserved between the primary tumor and metastasis from the same patient, although in general metastases acquired additional rearrangement events. Our study suggests that analysis of structural variation in tumor genomes could be useful for identifying tumor origin, facilitating cancer detection via measurement of rearrangements in circulating tumor DNA, and estimating degree of relatedness between primary tumors and metastases. Moreover, our finding that distant metastases have a close clonal relationship to the primary tumor at the level of chromosomal structure is most consistent with chromosomal rearrangements being early events in breast cancer progression that remain stable during the development from a primary tumor to its distant metastasis.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","Bioinformatics","Whole Genome Sequencing","Structural Variants"],"title":"Abstract 4805: Whole genome sequencing of primary breast cancers and matched distant metastases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lao H.

To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and establish real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. In the first phase, we focus on molecular profiling by next-generation RNA-sequencing on the Illumina platform. In the first 3 years from 30 August 2010 through 31 August 2013, we have consented and enrolled 3,979 patients with primary breast cancer at the seven hospital sites in South Sweden, representing approximately 85% of eligible patients in the catchment area. Preoperative blood samples have been collected for 3,942 (99%) patients and primary tumor specimens collected for 2,929 (74%) patients.

Starting from version 6.2, FreeBSD provides support for it by means of the audit(4) kernel subsystem.\nThis talk aims at introducing the FreeBSD audit(4) facility, its supporting tools and benefits, as well as its limitations.\n","tags":["Open Source Software","FreeBSD","Computer Security"],"title":"Practical Security Event Auditing with FreeBSD","type":"event"},{"authors":["Christian Brueffer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1238544e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1238544e3,"objectID":"41d94ba1787bc845924cfee9ba78d3e4","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/publication/2009_bsd_magazine_auditing/","publishdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_bsd_magazine_auditing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["FreeBSD","Open Source Software"],"title":"FreeBSD Security Event Auditing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1195311600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1195311600,"objectID":"677d864def939f7c9b058be005305fd8","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/protecting-your-privacy-with-freebsd-and-tor/","publishdate":"2007-11-17T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/protecting-your-privacy-with-freebsd-and-tor/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Open Source Software","FreeBSD","Computer Security"],"title":"Protecting your Privacy with FreeBSD and Tor","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1151146800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1151146800,"objectID":"ea2a400c9d125a00d7da4cc6ddd722d6","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/freebsd-im-uberblick/","publishdate":"2006-06-24T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/freebsd-im-uberblick/","section":"event","summary":"FreeBSD ist ein freies, UNIX-ähnliches Betriebssystem. Es wird von einem weltweiten Team aus Freiwilligen entwickelt und von Firmen wie Yahoo!, Apple und Juniper eingesetzt, oder als Basis für eigene Produkte verwendet. Dieser Vortrag soll einen Einblick in den Aufbau und die Arbeitsweise des FreeBSD Projektes geben. Er soll außerdem zeigen, welche Eigenschaften FreeBSD zu einem beliebten Betriebssystem sowohl für Server als auch für Workstations machen.","tags":["Open Source Software","FreeBSD"],"title":"FreeBSD im Überblick","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1088168400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1088168400,"objectID":"d596445e88d424278b0c08d057173e38","permalink":"https://www.brueffer.io/talk/what-is-freebsd/","publishdate":"2004-06-25T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/what-is-freebsd/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Open Source Software","FreeBSD"],"title":"What is FreeBSD?","type":"event"}]
