Many people worldwide work on
translating these insights into the clinic to improve diagnostic areas such as patient risk stratification and treatment selection.
Most of these efforts focus on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Illumina_%28Solexa%29_sequencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA-based short-read high-throughput sequencing (DNA-seq)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)&lt;/a> is a sister technology to DNA-seq that probes the current state of the cell&amp;rsquo;s transcriptional machinery (the transcriptome)
and is commonly used for research, but is underused as a diagnostic tool. RNA-seq is inexpensive and can provide a wealth of information that
is not accessible from DNA (gene/isoform expression), in addition to being able, to some degree, to detect features commonly determined from DNA
(e.g., point mutations, short insertions and deletions, copy number, structural variants). As such it is possible to develop a variety of diagnostics
that can be derived from a single sequencing dataset, making RNA-seq a potentially powerful diagnostic tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic of my PhD thesis was exploring the diagnostic power of RNA-seq by developing and evaluating computational resources for the
&lt;a href="https://www.scan-b.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network&amp;ndash;Breast (SCAN-B)&lt;/a> breast cancer project and by developing diagnostic tools from the generated
data. Within SCAN-B the vast majority of breast cancer patients from the participating hospital regions
are being enrolled since 2010, and RNA-seq data is being generated from their tumors within one week from surgery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See below for a list of results generated from this work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SCAN-B MutationExplorer</title><link>https://www.brueffer.io/project/mutationexplorer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brueffer.io/project/mutationexplorer/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>To facilitate research cancer datasets these days get ever larger. Within the &lt;a href="https://www.scan-b.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network&amp;ndash;Breast&lt;/a> thousands of
breast tumors have already undergone &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RNA sequencing&lt;/a>, and the number grows daily. In a &lt;a href="../../publication/scanb_mutational_landscape_primary_bc/">recent research project&lt;/a>
we demonstrated that this data can be used to call somatic mutations, which can e.g. help guide patient treatment or be used as targets for detecting &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulating_tumor_DNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating tumor DNA&lt;/a> in
patient blood samples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this project we provide the web portal &lt;a href="https://oncogenomics.bmc.lu.se/MutationExplorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCAN-B Mutationexplorer&lt;/a> to enable the exploration of mutations from 3,217 primary breast tumor transcriptomes.
The underlying software, MutationExplorer, is freely available on GitHub and can be adapted to other datasets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FreeBSD</title><link>https://www.brueffer.io/project/freebsd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brueffer.io/project/freebsd/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeBSD&lt;/a> is an open source Unix-like operating system that can be
found (as a whole or in parts) in Apple macOS and iOS, Sony Playstation 4, Juniper routers
and NetApp storage filers, to name a few. It also powers services such as Netflix and WhatsApp.
I have been a developer with the project since 2003, and also contribute to related security-focused
projects such as &lt;a href="http://www.trustedbsd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrustedBSD&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/openbsm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenBSM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
